In-game-debugging-tool
======================

In-game debugging tool for Monkey-X cross-translator.
This tool allows the developer to drag & drop game objects and use dev-console for various things;
 - View object's fields, methods ...everything that's public
 - Set selected object's field values
 - Call object's methods with various input types. Currently supported; Int, Float, String, Bool and Arrays.
 - View what's inside a class (constants, fields, methods, globals, functions [if public] and super-class if reflected)


 Please be aware that this tool is under heavy development and it might not be stable - at all. Use at your own risk!
