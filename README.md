In-game-debugging-tool
======================

In-game debugging tool for Monkey-X cross-translator.
This tool is very easy to attach to any game engine and it allows the developer
to drag & drop game objects and use dev-console for various things;
 - View object's fields, methods ...everything that's public
 - Set selected object's field values
 - Call object's methods with various input types. Currently supported; Int, Float, String, Bool and Arrays
 - View classes constants, fields, methods, globals, functions (if public) and super-class (if reflected)
 - Variable watch for objects (fields) and classes (globals)

Please be aware that this tool is under heavy development and it might not be stable - at all.
Use at your own risk!
